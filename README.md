# bittrex-scanner

This is a pet project that I'm creating to scan the [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com) market and look for entry points on the different 'BTC-*' tickers. It grabs the candles for each ticker and performs some technical analysis on those candles, then 'texts' (it's actually email) you as an alert if on meets one of those algorithm's entry conditions.
